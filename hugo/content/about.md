My name is Travis Reid Hopkins. You can call me Reid (he/him)!

I graduated from Central Connecticut State University in 2023 and have been
working in the industry as a DevOps engineer since. I'm interested in gimmicky
computer science tricks, system administration, and cybersecurity. In my free
time I also play Bridge.
